# dmenu-scripts

As I'm planning to move to Wayland, I decided to use `bemenu` for my scripts instead of `dmenu`. Here you can find all of my original `dmenu scripts.

## License
As these scripts were originally from [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/neo64yt/glorious-dotfiles) which is under the GNU GPLv3, this repository also uses the same license.
